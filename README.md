# Fashion-GAN-implementation

This project is an implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating fashion-related images, such as clothing items. The GAN is trained on a dataset of fashion images to generate new, realistic fashion designs.

# Features
# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN):
Uses a GAN architecture to generate fashion images.
# Training on Fashion Dataset:
The model is trained on a custom dataset of clothing and accessories.
# Customizable GAN Architecture:
Modify the generator and discriminator for experimentation.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MairAhmed/Fashion-GAN-implementation.git

cd Fashion-GAN-implementation

# Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
NumPy
Matplotlib
